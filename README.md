# Wi-Fi Password Retriever

## Project Overview
The **Wi-Fi Password Retriever** is a Python script designed to extract and display passwords for Wi-Fi networks that are already saved on your Windows computer. This tool only extracts passwords for networks you have previously connected to and does not attempt to crack or access unauthorized networks.

1. Ensure you have **Python 3** installed on your Windows machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone the repository or download the `wifi_password_retriever.py` file.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
3. There are no additional dependencies to install, as the script uses built-in Python libraries.

## Usage
To use the Wi-Fi Password Retriever, follow these steps:

1. Open a Command Prompt (make sure to run it with administrative privileges).
2. Navigate to the directory where `wifi_password_retriever.py` is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:
    ```bash
